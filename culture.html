        last 2000 years. What makes them unique

        of a single piece of stone, it is well-proportioned, free-standing with well polished surface. The Didarganj
        Chauri Bearer is widely viewed by archaeologists as one of the finest and most precious artefacts of ancient
        Indian sculptural art.<br><br>Several bronze sculptures from ancient era are also found in Bihar state. Thorough

        <h2>Architecture in Bihar </h2>Bihar has exemplified with unique architectural significance since time
        immemorial. Their traces are seen from the Vedic period itself that has always maintained its uniqueness with
        architecture. State’s architecture remained example for rest in country and in the far off regions round the
        world wherever its typical architectural richness went. Bihar architecture of ancient era witnessed typical use
        of stones, woods and bricks to develop exceptionally compelling architectural designs.Unique architecture
        therefore mixed stone, wooden and brick materials to develop the individualistic identity. Besides developing
        unique designs such architectures had added benefits of assuring maximum durability. One can witness the work of
        Mauryan architecture in the Barabar Mounts. <br><br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://im.hunt.in/cg/Bihar/About/Profile/Culture/baeds.jpg"
                alt="Architecture in Bihar" title="Barabar Caves"></div><br>Grottoe of Lomas Richi. 3rd century BCE. The
        Barabar Caves are amongst the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India. History explains about the display of
        amazing architecture in Bihar’s kingdoms in ancient periods. Take for example information garnered from the
        famous Megasthenes that explain about the ancient city of Pataliputra having been aesthetically encircled
        through wooden materials to make it a replica of palisade. <br><br>Another example of Bihar state’s
        distinguished architecture can be found in the Nalanda and Vikramshila ruins built from brick and masonry
        mounds. Bihar’s architecture has shown way to several Southeast and East Asian countries. Take for example the
        numerous Buddhist stupas with their distinct dome shaped monuments present in various parts of the world today.
        They are indeed an inspiration from the rich architecture of Bihar state since ancient period. Many excavations
        have already proved those facts in the modern day Patna whose ancient city structure was truly appealing due to
        beautiful architecture. Artistic designs of monuments and sacred relics in Bihar have remained pathfinders for
        the future cultures since many centuries. The pagoda to Westerners, stupas, viharas and numerous artistically
        designed temples from the Mauryan regime showed the world to explore its unique architecture. Wooden, stone,
        bricks and iron architecture are some of the distinct forms and so is notable rock cut architecture of Bihar.
        They can be best seen in temples with elliptical, circular, quadrilateral and apsidal designs. Mixed
        architectural designs of Bihar in the medieval period showed various concepts including blend styles with Indian
        and ancient Roman architecture designs to Hellenestic that were then evidenced from the Greco-Buddhist
        architectural forms. <br><br>Completely revamped Islamic architecture came in Bihar with the arrival of Mughal
        in India in 15th century and their expansion in this region. Even today, one witnesses various tombs prepared
        from various types of sandstone and marble having complete Persian influence. Some of the witnesses of Mughal
        architecture in India are of Sher Shah Suri Tomb, Makhdum Daulat, Maner Sharif and et al. The replica of modern
        architecture in Bihar is assessed from the buildings in the state capital and other historic areas. The
        buildings of Patna High Court, Bihar Vidhan Sabha, Bihar Vidhan Parishad, Transport Bhawan, Patna, Golghar St.
        Mary's Church and Patna Museum are among those famous for their Indo-Saracenic architectural styles. The state
        has already welcomed good number of modern architectural projects prevailing in other parts of the country but
        they still maintain the distinct Bihari architectural values.<br>
